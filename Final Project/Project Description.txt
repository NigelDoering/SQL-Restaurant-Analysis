Project Description

Use the CSV files in the folder called restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings.

Look at the data and come up with a set of Functional Dependencies. 
Create a new schema, using these functional dependencies, ensuring that your schema is in 3NF.

Now, answer the following questions using one or more SQL queries. You should submit your SQL queries along with the first 10 rows of each result.

(a) Based on the statistics, which cuisine will a person who is interested in technology most likely to choose? Describe your ranking criteria.
(b) Based on the data provided, which cuisine is most popular (they serve people with very different characteristics), which is most exclusive (they serve people with very similar characteristics)?
(c) Based on the customer information provided, list 3 ranked choices of restaurant for two customers below. customerOrdering	timePreferred	Cuisine		Preference			Time allowance
U1004				Mon 18:00		Mexican		Price > rating		Fast
U1124				Sat 22:00		FastFood	Rating > Price		Whatever
(d) Find the top 10 people who give the most # of rating and find all the information about these people and their rating diversity (e.g., how "evenly" do they rate restaurants?).
(e) Suppose you are a rich investor with 200 million dollars to invest, what type of restaurant will you invest and where, why? This is a data science question and your answer should be based on queries you have come up with to make your decision evidence-based. 
The criteria could be like:
 (i) I want to build a restaurant in cities that don’t have many restaurants currently, but they are perspective (their restaurants receive higher ratings and suppose there are no geographic bias in rating)
 (ii) I want to invest in “little pizza”and make it franchise because I think franchising can increase sales and pizza restaurants seem to be very popular in that city.
  (iii)...... (come up with your own!!)
